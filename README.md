## üöÄ Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Ingestion & CRM Sync

* Pull Braze user data directly into **BigQuery** (or via S3 for large exports).
* Automate incremental updates for **millions of users**.
* Supports **connected content** JSON generation per user.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Analytics & DBT Models

* **Retention & Lifecycle:** D1/D7/D30 retention, silent vs active churn, cohort analysis.
* **Growth & Product:** MAU/DAU trends, spikes/dips, category switching, basket analysis.
* **Marketing:** Campaign variance, voucher elasticity, multi-channel impact, MTA/MMM prep.
* Built-in **DBT models** for analytics, monitoring, and feature engineering.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Predictive Analytics

* ML notebooks and pipelines for:

  * **Churn prediction**
  * **Customer LTV (PLTV) modeling**
  * **Promo response & personalization scoring**
* Direct integration with connected content for **1:1 campaigns**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Activation & Connected Content

* Generate **per-user JSON content** for Braze campaigns.
* Supports AWS S3 + optional CloudFront for secure delivery.
* Works for push, email, and in-app messaging.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Orchestration & Monitoring

* **Airflow DAGs** for daily, weekly, and monthly jobs.
* Slack alerts for:

  * Data ingestion delays
  * Variance between Braze and BigQuery counts
  * Predictive model failures
* Retention, funnel, and campaign metrics tracked automatically.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Documentation & Deployment

* `docs/architecture.md`: Full architecture diagram.
* `docs/connected_content.md`: Connected Content setup.
* `.env.example` and `profiles.yml` for dbt.
* `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.

## üìà Analytics & Monitoring

* **Retention & Lifecycle:** Track churn, retention, reactivation.
* **Growth & Product:** DAU/MAU trends, basket analysis, category switching.
* **Marketing Campaigns:** Compare Braze vs BigQuery counts, identify spikes/dips.
* **Predictive:** Churn scoring, LTV prediction, connected content personalization.

---

## üîß Opinionated Practices

* Use **direct Braze ‚Üí BigQuery** ingestion for small-to-medium segments.
* Use **S3 staging** for very large exports (>1M users).
* All **predictive models feed directly into connected content generation**.
* Airflow handles orchestration, retries, and alerting.
* dbt for analytics, monitoring, and features ensures **version control & reproducibility**.
